There is no \"agent mode\" visible in any of the settings. When asked, Copilot itself says that it is not supported in the PHPStorm plugin. Maybe it is hidden in the UI somewhere, or perhaps, like the available LLMs, it depends entirely upon an account setting out of reach to institutional users where the accounts were set up by an admin.  There appears to be no path to discover it, although this update says agent mode is a feature.
