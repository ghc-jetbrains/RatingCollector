That is totally my opinion in that every Microsoft product I've ever used starting with DOS 6.2, Office, Office 365, etc. Always had features that ONLY worked inside microslop's products. I spent WEEKS on and off trying to figure out why Copilot gave me a error that it couldn't initialize a github login in IntelliJ. Worked great in VSCode (of course). Turns out that I had a setting in my .bashrc to set my proxies, and those proxies included my username / passwords (HTTP://username:password@myproxy.com).
