I tried it out and almost immediately I thought that Copilot didn't have the same functionality (or capabilities) to IDEs like Cursor, or Cline in VSCode.</p>\n<p>Then I tried VSCode and VisualStudio's Copilot integration and it was miles ahead to Rider's. This is so unfortunate. I like have AI integration in the IDE that I use but its nowhere near as functional as in other IDEs and also feels like I can't really use it--its a poor implementation.</p>\n<p>Please bring it up to parity!</p>\n","plugin":{"id":17718,"name":"GitHub Copilot","link":"/plugin/17718-github-copilot"},"repliesCount":0,"author":{"id":"83e7675d-6f51-46e5-94fc-6e76f9496a5d","name":"Dandre Jansen Van Vuuren","link":"/author/83e7675d-6f51-46e5-94fc-6e76f9496a5d","hubLogin":"dandre.jvv","icon":"https://hub.jetbrains.com/api/rest/avatar/83e7675d-6f51-46e5-94fc-6e76f9496a5d","showMarketoCheckbox":true},"vendor":false,"votes":{"positive":0,"negative":0},"markedAsSpam":false},{"id":123648,"rating":0,"isResolveRequested":false,"resolveState":"INIT","cdate":"1756206318000","comment":"<p>Amazing update!
