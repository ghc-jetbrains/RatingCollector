But Copilot in VSCode is a way better experience. Its suggestions are more contextual and intelligent. I can add a variable to one file and export it, go to another file, begin to type and Copilot is already suggesting what to do with that variable and it's often very accurate. Whereas with WebStorm it doesn't seem to have that context of what was recently typed between files and what files are currently open.</p>\n","plugin":{"id":17718,"name":"GitHub Copilot","link":"/plugin/17718-github-copilot"},"repliesCount":0,"author":{"id":"116a961b-a38e-41c6-82cd-b5faf8a4367d","name":"David Jozwik","link":"/author/116a961b-a38e-41c6-82cd-b5faf8a4367d","hubLogin":"david.275","icon":"https://hub.jetbrains.com/api/rest/avatar/116a961b-a38e-41c6-82cd-b5faf8a4367d","showMarketoCheckbox":true},"vendor":false,"votes":{"positive":1,"negative":0},"markedAsSpam":false},{"id":126832,"rating":4,"isResolveRequested":false,"resolveState":"INIT","cdate":"1759825313000","comment":"<p>I'll give Copailot another chance</p>\n","plugin":{"id":17718,"name":"GitHub Copilot","link":"/plugin/17718-github-copilot"},"repliesCount":0,"author":{"id":"e62d6bd7-a69e-4265-8383-752022949e6b","name":"Dmitry Skibitsky","link":"/author/e62d6bd7-a69e-4265-8383-752022949e6b","hubLogin":"dmitryskibitskiy","icon":"https://hub.jetbrains.com/api/rest/avatar/e62d6bd7-a69e-4265-8383-752022949e6b","showMarketoCheckbox":true},"vendor":false,"votes":{"positive":1,"negative":1},"markedAsSpam":false},{"id":126777,"rating":1,"isResolveRequested":false,"resolveState":"INIT","cdate":"1759746299000","comment":"<p>Constants relogins.
