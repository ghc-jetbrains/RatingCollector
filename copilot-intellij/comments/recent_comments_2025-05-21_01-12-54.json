And it displays an Authorize button. Clicking the Authorize button in the chat view does nothing. No errors or anything, just nothing.\nTo \"authorize\" again, the only workaround I've found is to click the other Copilot icon in the Status bar of the Intellij window, then Logout. After logging out, you click the status bar Copilot icon and do a fresh Login. This will give you a new device code and a login url where you can use the code.
