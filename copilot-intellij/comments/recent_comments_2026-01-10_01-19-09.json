Normally it swallows the first prompt you send after it initializes, so if you forget that, and write the prompt in the text entry box without copying it from somwehere else you can lose a ton of effort and time. And it will re-initialize after some time of not being used even if the IDE itself has remained open, so it can seem quite random when it swallows prompts.</p>\n<p>It frequently hangs, saying that it is working, but seems to be stuck, on prompts that are not complicated enough to warrant a very long lapse.</p>\n<p>It frequently loses track of itself. The output stream of token responses will continue flowing even though the \"play\" / \"stop\" button has become disconnected from it, meaning that there is no way to stop the process, except to send a new process, or to close the IDE and start over.</p>\n<p>It doesn't know how to use its own tools very well. It will frequently <code>cat</code> files in the project instead of using it's own read_file tool.</p>\n<p>This is compounded by the fact that the AI Chat windows quickly loses the ability to see terminal output, but even though I explain this, and tell it to redirect output to file and read it with read_file, it will never remember this instruction for long, even when I attach it in COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md.</p>\n<p>It has no understanding of lint rules, and is generally terrible at following existing patterns in a codebase. If the goal is to understand the whole codebase it fails completely.</p>\n<p>Everytime it needs to open a new terminal, which is at least once per session, the first command is swallowed by the terminal (running Bazzite, and direnv, which both have shell init stuff that runs. Copiloyt is unable to comprehend, or remember, this limitation, and frequently gets lost trying to figure this out.</p>\n<p>It is VERY poorly integrated with the IDE.</p>\n<p>Everytime it changes a file the file is opened, made active, and the cursor hijacks typing into the file that Copilot is editing. This freqeuntly results in human typing being interleaved with AI edits, or otherwise mangling, deleting, moving, AI edits, depending on what keys I am hitting as it is hijacking the focus.</p>\n<p>This is bar none the worst user experience of any tool I have ever used.</p>\n","plugin":{"id":17718,"name":"GitHub Copilot - Your AI Pair Programmer","link":"/plugin/17718-github-copilot--your-ai-pair-programmer"},"repliesCount":0,"author":{"id":"9a4f0ca6-e902-4416-86d4-259c42991e88","name":"Peter Boling","link":"/author/9a4f0ca6-e902-4416-86d4-259c42991e88","hubLogin":"Peter.Boling","icon":"https://hub.jetbrains.com/api/rest/avatar/9a4f0ca6-e902-4416-86d4-259c42991e88","showMarketoCheckbox":true},"vendor":false,"votes":{"positive":0,"negative":0},"markedAsSpam":false},{"id":132308,"rating":3,"isResolveRequested":false,"resolveState":"INIT","cdate":"1767623834000","comment":"<p>I like it, but the thing I dislike the most is the text editor they're using.</p>\n<p>That's my biggest pain point atm.</p>\n","plugin":{"id":17718,"name":"GitHub Copilot - Your AI Pair Programmer","link":"/plugin/17718-github-copilot--your-ai-pair-programmer"},"repliesCount":0,"author":{"id":"f77f050d-85fd-47f5-868b-e46c2707122b","name":"adrian1358","link":"/author/f77f050d-85fd-47f5-868b-e46c2707122b","hubLogin":"Adrian_Smijulj","icon":"https://hub.jetbrains.com/api/rest/avatar/f77f050d-85fd-47f5-868b-e46c2707122b","showMarketoCheckbox":true},"vendor":false,"votes":{"positive":1,"negative":0},"markedAsSpam":false},{"id":132271,"rating":5,"isResolveRequested":false,"resolveState":"INIT","cdate":"1767598595000","comment":"<p>Works as expected.
