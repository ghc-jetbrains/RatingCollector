There are so many usability issues I don't know where to start, but let me try anyway:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>if you want to add an attachment to a chat, you either use the #file prefix or use the mouse to click the attachment symbol, so far so good. Then the search popup opens and you happily type away until you notice that the text input isn't focused and there's no hotkey for it. Why?! WHY?! You have to use the mouse to focus it.</li>\n<li>Sometimes the chat input doesn't accept the space bar (?!)</li>\n<li>nowadays half of the tool calls fail, and there's no way to check what's going on, you can't see any output</li>\n<li>you cannot modify the instructions anymore using the agent mode, because there's a new section in the setting preventing the agent from accessing it (good security measure, thumbs up). BUT, you CANNOT disable it by exclusion list. You cannot disable that.... why offer it then?</li>\n<li>the versionening between chat interactions is not working at all. I don't know what they implemented there, but it is certainly not rolling back the changes probably. If you use this, you're guaranteed to have a messed up files afterwards. Only use GIT or similar for versioning, never rely on the copilot's feature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>... there's definitely more where this came from.
