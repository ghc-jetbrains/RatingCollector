This is just a fact, but the plugin feels rather like a bit of a hack because so much is left to guesswork.</p>\n<p>I just updated to the latest version as of today.  There is no \"agent mode\" visible in any of the settings. When asked, Copilot itself says that it is not supported in the PHPStorm plugin. Maybe it is hidden in the UI somewhere, or perhaps, like the available LLMs, it depends entirely upon an account setting out of reach to institutional users where the accounts were set up by an admin.  There appears to be no path to discover it, although this update says agent mode is a feature. So, back I got to VSCode....</p>\n","plugin":{"id":17718,"name":"GitHub Copilot","link":"/plugin/17718-github-copilot"},"rating":0,"repliesCount":1,"author":{"id":"48b493b9-9a8e-4285-826b-b636f5f2f6f4","name":"Mitchell Amiano","link":"/author/48b493b9-9a8e-4285-826b-b636f5f2f6f4","hubLogin":"mcamiano","icon":"https://hub.jetbrains.com/api/rest/avatar/48b493b9-9a8e-4285-826b-b636f5f2f6f4","showMarketoCheckbox":true},"vendor":false,"votes":{"positive":1,"negative":0},"markedAsSpam":false},{"id":118919,"cdate":"1749117159000","comment":"<p>It's ok.

This is good because I use Rider so I don't have to use VS Code anymore. In Rider the agent runs the tests and fixes the code, and runs the tests again. I could not figure out how to get the agent to do that in VS Code. If I could make one suggestion, it would be for GitHub Copilot to add a prompt library. Other similar tools do this, and it is the one glaring omission that could use some attention. This plugin is not well documented, but if you read the documentation for the VS Code plugin you should be able to muddle through.</p>\n","plugin":{"id":17718,"name":"GitHub Copilot","link":"/plugin/17718-github-copilot"},"rating":4,"repliesCount":0,"author":{"id":"9db0b109-ae2d-41eb-bf54-5d7c96979954","name":"Adam Adair","link":"/author/9db0b109-ae2d-41eb-bf54-5d7c96979954","hubLogin":"adair.adam","icon":"https://hub.jetbrains.com/api/rest/avatar/9db0b109-ae2d-41eb-bf54-5d7c96979954","showMarketoCheckbox":true},"vendor":false,"votes":{"positive":0,"negative":0},"markedAsSpam":false},{"id":118527,"cdate":"1748434964000","comment":"<p>Overall, we have been pretty pleased with the implementation of this and it's features.
