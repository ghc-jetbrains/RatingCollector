However, my recent experience with this version in RubyMine has been marred by significant stability and performance issues.</p>\n<p>Based on my idea.log file analysis while troubleshooting problems like stuck indexing, very slow RuboCop execution, and incorrect syntax highlighting (e.g., for method names), the Copilot plugin appears to be a major contributing factor, if not the root cause.</p>\n<p>Here's what I observed in the logs:</p>\n<p>Frequent Request Cancellations: The log is flooded with JsonRpcErrorException: Request was canceled errors (error code -32800) related to com.github.copilot. While cancellations can happen, the sheer frequency suggests potential underlying issues (timeouts, internal errors?) that might be impacting IDE performance and responsiveness.</p>\n<p>Severe UI Rendering Error: A critical SEVERE NullPointerException occurred within Java's UI rendering (sun.java2d.pipe.AlphaColorPipe related to drawing icons like RoundedIcon). The IDE explicitly logged Plugin to blame: GitHub Copilot version: 1.5.40-243 for this error. This indicates a significant bug within the plugin's UI code.\nUI Freezes: This severe error happened shortly after a recorded UI freeze lasting over 8 seconds, suggesting the plugin's activity might be contributing to or triggering these freezes.</p>\n<p>Internal Errors: Other warnings like BugIndicatingError: Invalid range also appeared, pointing towards internal issues within the Copilot agent/plugin logic.\nImpact on IDE: The instability caused by these Copilot errors seems to directly affect core RubyMine functions. When Copilot struggles or causes freezes, background tasks like indexing appear to get stuck or corrupted, external tools like RuboCop become unresponsive within the IDE, and syntax highlighting breaks down because the IDE loses its understanding of the code structure.\nTroubleshooting:</p>\n<p>Temporarily disabling the GitHub Copilot plugin seemed to alleviate the core indexing, RuboCop responsiveness, and syntax highlighting issues, further strengthening the suspicion that the plugin was the primary cause of the disruption.</p>\n<p>I genuinely believe Copilot is a valuable tool. However, the stability issues encountered with version 1.5.40-243 in RubyMine 2024.3.5 are currently too disruptive for a smooth workflow. I strongly encourage the developers to investigate the frequent request cancellations and particularly the NullPointerException in the UI rendering code.</p>\n<p>I look forward to future updates with improved stability so I can reliably integrate Copilot back into my daily development process.</p>\n","plugin":{"id":17718,"name":"GitHub Copilot","link":"/plugin/17718-github-copilot"},"rating":2,"repliesCount":0,"author":{"id":"8625b3c5-3006-4823-97fe-31c58e3e57b0","name":"kobah90","link":"/author/8625b3c5-3006-4823-97fe-31c58e3e57b0","hubLogin":"Kadir_Ozan_Bahar","icon":"https://hub.jetbrains.com/api/rest/avatar/8625b3c5-3006-4823-97fe-31c58e3e57b0","showMarketoCheckbox":true},"vendor":false,"votes":{"positive":0,"negative":0},"markedAsSpam":false},{"id":115149,"cdate":"1743696586000","comment":"<p>I don't know what people are so mad about.
